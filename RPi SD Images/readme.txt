Rasbian Introduction - 

Raspbian is the Raspberry Pi Foundationâ€™s official supported operating system. You can install it with NOOBS or download the image below and follow our installation guide. Raspbian comes pre-installed with plenty of software for education, programming and general use. It has Python, Scratch, Sonic Pi, Java, Mathematica and more.

The Raspbian with Desktop image contained in the ZIP archive is over 4GB in size, which means that these archives use features which are not supported by older unzip tools on some platforms. If you find that the download appears to be corrupt or the file is not unzipping correctly, please try using 7Zip (Windows) or The Unarchiver (Macintosh). Both are free of charge and have been tested to unzip the image correctly.

openHABian Introduction - 

The Raspberry Pi and other small single-board computers are quite famous platforms for openHAB. However, setting up a fully working Linux system with all recommended packages and openHAB recommendations is a boring task taking quite some time and Linux newcomers shouldn't worry about these technical details.

A home automation enthusiast doesn't have to be a Linux enthusiast!

openHABian aims to provide a self-configuring system specific to the needs of every openHAB user.
Ready to install images are available for the Raspberry Pi and the Pine A64. openHABian can also be used on existing Debian based Linux systems. Follow the links below to learn more:
